## Welcome to Easyplume

Easyplume is Open-Source code package, written in Python developed with the strong intention of providing fast implemetation and physical 
understantig of hypersonic plasma plume expansions.

Use Easyplume code if your are searching for:

- Modularaized Object-Oriented Scripting that provides quick plasma plume expansion results, based on two well known
semi-analytical plume expansion models:  The Asymptotic Expansion Method and The Self-Similar Expansion Method.

- Understanding on the libraries as well as numerical logic and techniques used in the simulation of plume expansions with Python.

- A simple plume code Python package to be used for tailored applications.
