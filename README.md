## Welcome to HyperPlume

HyperPlume is Open-Source code package, written in Python developed with the strong intention of providing fast implemetation and physical 
understantig of hypersonic plasma plume expansions.

Use HyperPlume code if your are searching for:

- Modularaized Object-Oriented Scripting that provides quick plasma plume expansion results, based on two well known
semi-analytical plume expansion models:  The Asymptotic Expansion Method and The Self-Similar Expansion Method.

- Understanding on the libraries as well as numerical logic and techniques used in the simulation of plume expansions with Python.

- A simple plume code Python package to be used for tailored applications.

The HyperPlume Project was developed as part of the final degree dissertation for the Aerospace Engineering Bachelors held at the Univeristy Charles III of Madrid. The project was made possible thanks to the invaluable help of the EP2 university investigation group and my tutor, Mario Merino Martinez.
